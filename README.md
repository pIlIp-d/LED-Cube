# LED-Cube
A LED cube that is filled with digital water.

## Idea

The goal is to create a LED cube that operates on its own with included battery and micro controller.

Possible hardware considerations are 8x8 LED matrices (e.g. ATMA12W83) put together as a cube with microcontroller and attery in the middle.


It should behave like a little glass cube filled with water.

## TODO

- [x] Fist working virtual DEMO including all the logic.
- [ ] Port the project to a Microcontroller and build the hardware.
- [ ] Possibly some optimisation with lookup tables etc.
- [ ] Inertia implementation if it feels wrong.
